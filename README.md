# Laravel Doctrine 2 ODM for MongoDB [WIP]

A smart, lightweight Laravel wrapper around the [Doctrine ODM](https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm) document mapper. 
Features convenient features like soft deletions, automatic create and modification times, and consistent and flexible response formats useful when developing APIs.  

This ODM wrapper is compatible with jensseger's [laravel-mongodb](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb) library, should you want to leverage both Eloquent and Doctrine at the same time. 
 
Note: a "minimum-stability" of "dev" is currently required for this package.  

Please check out the [chefsplate/laravel-doctrine-odm-example](https://github.com/chefsplate/laravel-doctrine-odm-example) repo for a fully-working example of how this package can be used to create a Doctrine-based API on top of Mongo.
 
## Requirements
- PHP 5.4+
- Laravel 5.3+ (for Laravel 5.1 - 5.2, please use the 5.1 branch)
- PHP mongo extension (ext-mongo) must be installed: http://php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php
    - On a Mac, the easiest way to install this extension is through `brew`: `brew install php56` followed by `brew install php56-mongo`

## Install

Require the latest version of this package with Composer:

    composer require chefsplate/laravel-doctrine-odm:"0.1.x"

Add the Service Provider to the providers array in config/app.php:

    ChefsPlate\ODM\Providers\DocumentMapperServiceProvider::class,
    
Add the facade to your class aliases array in config/app.php:

    'DocumentMapper' => ChefsPlate\ODM\Facades\DocumentMapper::class,

You should now be able to use the **mongodb** driver in config/database.php.

    'mongodb' => array(
        'driver'   => 'mongodb',
        'dsn'      => 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017',
        'database' => 'database_name'
    ),

The format for the DSN is:
`mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2:],...]/db`

# Eloquent-like Wrapper Methods

## `first` and `where`

`first` is an Eloquent-like way of constructing queries. It uses the arrow (associative array) notation of specifying parameters:

    $user = User::first([
        'username' => 'davidchchang'
    ]);
    
The `first` wrapper will automatically construct the query and fetch the first result returned, so if you want to retrieve more than one document or if you want to use specific query builder methods, you'll need to use `where` method instead.

    $users_named_david_chang = User::where([
        'first_name' => 'David',
        'last_name' => 'Chang'
    ])->getQuery()->execute();
    
    foreach ($users_named_david_chang as $user) {
        // do something with $user here
    }

There is an additional caveat with using these wrapper methods; the `first` and `where` wrapper methods only work with non-entities such as strings, booleans, numbers, and regexes. 
If you want to use any (non-equals) [conditional operators](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/reference/query-builder-api.html#conditional-operators), 
you'll need to chain them before executing the query (note: `first` does not support chaining since it executes the query immediately).

    $recent_user_tasks = Task::where([
        'status' => 'Active'
    ])->field('created_at')->gte(new \MongoDate($date->getTimestamp()))
      ->field('user')->references($user)
      ->getQuery()->execute();

Both `first` and `where` allow you to define an array of projections you would like returned. For example, if you only care about the username and email address fields being set on the returned models, you can specify this in the second parameter:

    $users_named_david = User::where([
        'first_name' => new \MongoRegex('/^David/i')
    ], ['username', 'email']);

## `find`

`find` will return the entity that corresponds to a specific ID.
 
    $user = User::find("davidchchang");

# ODM Helpers [coming soon]

## OdmHelper

`convertCarbonToMongoDate` will convert a Carbon date to a Mongo date:

    OdmHelper::convertCarbonToMongoDate(Carbon::parse('2016-11-17'))

# IDE helper for generating phpDocumentation

If you're familiar with @barryvdh's IDE helper for generating phpDocumentation (useful for auto-complete), we have built on top of his command generator.

To get started, add the Service Provider to the providers array in config/app.php:

    ChefsPlate\ODM\Providers\IdeOdmHelperServiceProvider::class,
    
## Usage

The default usage will analyze all models under App\Entities and write all annotations to a `_ide_helper_models.php` file.

    php artisan ide-helper:doctrine-models

You can alternatively choose to write annotations directly to the PHP DocBlock class annotations within the PHP files themselves.

If the annotations contain duplicates, you can use the --reset option to replace existing DocBlock annotations:

    php artisan ide-helper:doctrine-models --reset
    
Or specifically, to reset a single entity:

    php artisan ide-helper:doctrine-models App\Entities\ModelName --reset

For complete usage on generating helper annotations, use `--help`:

    php artisan ide-helper:doctrine-models --help
